My main account (incipious#7492, ID: 179696307470991360) was deactivated. I am not revealing the terms of my ban, but I have a few issues at hand here. 1) Diablo is registered on my main account, but that shouldn't be an issue considering that I can always port over Diablo to a new token on a new account. I have filed an appeal with Discord but I am not expecting to regain access to my account anytime soon, so in the scenario that I don't get reinstated, we will have to remake the Diablo on my new account plus a new token. Don't worry, I have all the code saved on my computer so no progress will be lost. I will fill you in more once I get more information.",color=0xf7f7f7)

Diablo also serves as data collection, so we can create one of the most extensive ban lists on Discord to prevent as many predatory incidents as possible. Think of it as this way- what would be more efficient: curing an illness or preventing an illness?
